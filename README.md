Posting Bits
==============

A Library for Designing Seamless Interactive Environments in Processing.

This library was developed as part of my Master Thesis in Interface Design at the [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam](http://design.fh-potsdam.de), named *POSTING BITS – Exploring new Interaction Paradigms using Sticky Notes, Paper Maps and Sketches*.

Notice that this is a beta version and you can find some bugs or inconsistencies. Please, share your findings in the [issues section](https://github.com/jorditost/PostingBits/issues) of this repository and feel free to fork and contribute.

## Computer Vision. Filtering and tracking.

The computer vision filtering is optimized to track the Post-its attached to a wall, but by calibrating the filters it can be used to track other things.

A more complete documentation on this will follow.

## Dependencies

Developed with the [OpenCV library](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing) for [Processing](http://processing.org/) by Greg Borenstein.

If you work with Kinect, you'll also need the [SimpleOpenNI library](https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/).

You'll also need the [controlP5 library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) for Processing for some of the utils and calibration sketches.
